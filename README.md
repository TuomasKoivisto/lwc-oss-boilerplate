# lwc-oss-boilerplate

Salesforce developer experience outside of Salesforce. LWC OSS (https://lwc.dev/) project with Lightning base components, Lightning design system and Jest.

## Motivation

If you're a Salesforce developer familiar with Salesforce Lightning Web Components (https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/documentation/en/lwc), you also might want to use your skills outside Salesforce to build frontend applications. It's possible with Lightning web components open source, but create-lwc-app doesn't provide lightning base components and Lightning Design system out of the box. This project shows how it's done.


## Steps 

1. Do as instructed by lightning base components documentation (https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/2020/12/build-connected-apps-anywhere-using-lightning-base-components)
2. Make it work with Jest https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/questions/348971/lwc-oss-lightning-base-components-jest-tests by **Dave C**

## The Result

You can now use:
- Lightning Web Components open source (https://lwc.dev/)
- Lightning base components (https://www.npmjs.com/package/lightning-base-components)
- Lightning Design System: (https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/)
- Jest for unit testing (https://lwc.dev/guide/test)
